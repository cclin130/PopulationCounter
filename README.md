# PopulationCounter
MATLAB Script which accepts a video of a bacteria culture and determines its population growth.

User inputs video file name, name of culture, desired accuracy, and frame rate.

Further improvements:
-Introduce GUI for user's ease
-Increase versatility
	-video analysis is not entirely accurate if low contrast between cell and rest of culture
-Further data analytics, regressions
-Display frames and plot graph simultaneously
